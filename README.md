# Pet-AR
Cleaned lab code as framework. XR and Animation Rigger imported 
(You might need to use the preview Unity Packages to import the Rigger / IK stuff).
The placed prefab is a cat from the unity store:

https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/lowpoly-toon-cat-lite-66083
It idles and looks at the character or an item it likes.
Inventory system seems hard to comprehend, almost done with basic cat anims too
